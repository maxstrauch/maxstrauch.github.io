Hi, my name Max and I'm a BSc computer scientist, software developer, web designer and maker from Germany. I'm currently "working on" my MSc degree in computer science with emphasis on Mobile Systems Engineering. Beside my studies I relly like to _make_ things like electronics or furniture and doing woodworking in general. Beneath that I like movies and nature (see left).

The intend of this blog has multiple layers: first of all I wanted to start a blog since 2010 (six years of prep time - beat that!) and I also wanted to practice my written English to improve it and maybe someone out there can get a use out of my experiences.

_Happy reading!_

P.S.: If you want to talk to me write me a mail to _<span class="magic" data-str="moc.liamel42goog@hcuar42tsx42am">(sorry: Javascript disabled)</span>_.
