I started programming with imperative and procedural programming languages (TurboPASCAL, Delphi etc.) and then headed over to scripting languages and object oriented languages - just like most people would start programming. 

__But:__ on my way I also discovered functional programming languages like [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) and [Prolog](http://www.swi-prolog.org/). Even if I don't see a high practically relevance this programming languages are very cool and worth a deeper look.
