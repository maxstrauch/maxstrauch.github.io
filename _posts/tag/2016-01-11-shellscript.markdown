Since I've many systems which run Linux (my Pis and some servers which I managed or owned over the years) I always came into situations where I needed a quick script which performed some simple batch operation. By example downloading a file, compiling it in place and then uploading it to a certain location or a little user manager with `dialog` to manage users over `ssh`. So this tag contains them all.
